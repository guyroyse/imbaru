# The Story of Imbaru

## The Eternals

The race of demigods incarnate are the oldest creatures to walk to spheres. They were before the Elves and Orcs, before the the Elementals, before the Fey, and before the Breaking.

## The City of the Eternals

The deepest layer of Caligos is the primeval City of the Eternals. It is in this place that the Eternals would meet and many dwelt before the Elementals and the Fey were created. Even once they arrived, the City of the Eternals was a place where they would all meet.

One of the Eternals, named *something or other* was really, really bad.


## The Fey War

In the ancient past, before the world was broken, the Fey and the Elementals had a great war. The Elementals broke the world in an attempt to sort the elements out and undremine how Life worked. The Fey sabotaged this efforts, and the world was broken instead. Everyone isolated into spheres with no way to reach each other, the war continued in small pockets until only tiny enclaves remained of the Fey and the Elementals.

# The Eternals Act

Many of the Eternals, seeing the effect that the breaking was having on life, created a series of gates to connect the spheres. The City of the Eternals, located where Imba

Broken into isolated spheres, the war turned into several small conflicts and simply ended. Elementals prevent the Fey from thriving but it backfired and both the Fey and the Elementals were driven to obscurity.

Deep beneath where the City of Caligos was to stand, there was a great Elemental power. A magical source of Earth around which the Dao has build their capital city. After the war, the city was in ruins but some of the Dao remained. And the power certainly remained.

The Fey, now divided into Seelie and Unseelie factions, setup outposts to keep an eye on the former capital city. These outposts still exists today.

## The Evil

There needs to be some sort of dark evil beneath the surface. Maybe a Dao superweapon that was unleashed?

## The Goblins

After the breaking, the goblins were the first humanoids to explore much of the world. Numerous and fast breeding, they spread across the lands and named many of the oldest things. They are still in the Redcap Caverns under Rot Ridge.

## The Elves

The Elves, looking for more power, discovered that there was a great magical source underground in this sphere. They build a settlement here which became a city. They dug to access to source and released something evil along the way and shattering the gate to the east. Something that had never occured before. The Elves studied the gate as they slowly died and eventually abandoned the city.

## Men & Dwarves

Man and Dwarves build a great city. The Holocaust happens as Carcerus leaves his station. Demons everywhere. People abandon the city. Demons remain in the Hellscathe Mountains.

# Recent Times

Kobolds have moved into the ruins of Claligos. Lizardfolk live in the swamps. Humans have a village and farms in the west. The Fey remain. The Dao remain. The Goblins remain. Demons dwell in the Hellscathe Mountains.
