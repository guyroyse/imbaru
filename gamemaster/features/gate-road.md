# Gate Road

The Gate Road runs north and south through Imbaru from **Northgate** to **Southgate**, hence the name. It is a old, dwarven-made road in relatively good repair given its age and lack of maintenance for 800 years. It is clear and easy to traverse, particularly in the north, with only a few sections reverting to dirt. In the south, some portions of the road have been damaged by tree roots and occasional floods leaving patches of dirt and broken, missing, and misplaced mounds of tiles.

Just south of Rivercross, a branch of the road leads to the **Ruins of Caligos**. Here the road is overgrown and the trees have done significantly more damage. Much of the road is broken or buckled. More has simply been buried by generations of forest debris. Nevertheless, many parts are intact and uncovered on the forest floor. The old road is easy to follow, if a bit rugged. And, it's obvious the they road is still used as footpaths connect and wind around and along the old sections of road.

The tiles that make up the road are individual pieces of granite. They are all carved with the intricate and angular tessellations that are favored by Dwarven craftsmen. Some of the tiles have the letters *Ϙ*¹ (for Caligos) or *Ι* (for Imbaru) within the patterns. Others have the full names, *ϘΑΛΙΓΟΣ*¹ and *ΙΜΒΑΡΥ* respectively.

The tiles that make up the road sit upon a bead or gravel and sand. In some places where the roads have been washed out, the gravel is exposed. The roads are edged with long, strait, and unadorned sections of granite.

¹ Note the use the to archaic Greek letter qoppa. In Myridia, amongst the Dwarves this is an archaic letter that the characters might not recognize as it was replaced with kappa centuries ago.
