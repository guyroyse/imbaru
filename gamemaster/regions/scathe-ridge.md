# Scathe Ridge

Scathe is an modern rendition of the old english word for criminal.

At end of the ridge is called Scathe Point. The ruins of a tower that once overlooked the north gate and the road heading south of it is there.

Bandits who occasionally rob those who travel the road are holed up here.
