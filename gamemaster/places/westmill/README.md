## Commerce

Westmill is off the beaten path and provides for most of its own needs. Commone items are readily available, but more complex or luxurious items, like armor and swords, are available but harder to come by as they have to be acquired by trade.

That said, Westmill is along a trade route, albiet an infrequently traversed one. They export a surplus of wool, tobacco, and medicinal herbs. Traders come, or pass through, and Westmill is an obvious place to rest for the evening. Because of this, there are two inns and a dining hall in Westmill.

Here are a few places of interest:

  - **Barlow's Inn** - Oswin Barlow run this basic inn and tavern where the prices are reasonable and the
    food is acceptable. Oswin himself is quite amiable and Barlow's is a good place to hear rumors.
  - **Hearth & Eagle** - John Arleigh runs the nicest inn and tavern in town. Prices are double normal but
    the food is excellent (try the braised cabbage and roast pork) and the beds are soft and warm. Every room
    is private and this is where wealthy merchants tend to stay.
  - **Sally's Sundries** - Sally Payton sells assorted and miscellaneous goods here.
  - **Thor's Tankard** - Run by Thor Ethelred, this dining hall and tavern is a popular place for locals and
    vistors alike. The food is good, the ale is plentiful, and the rumors are rampant.
  - **Hammer & Shield** - The only weapon and armor seller in town is a skinny, dark-haired man named Manius
    Valeria.
  - **The Apothecary** - Wanda Karlkin, a fast-talking Halfling runs the local apothecary. She gathers many of
    the herbs for her brews herself. Rumor has it that she can also provide poison for those with the coin.
  - **Stables** - Owned by John Arleigh, the town stables have a few horses for sale, and will happily stable
    a horse. Tack and harness can also be purchased here in an attached shop.

## Production

Westmill and the Vale provide for most of their own needs. They produce their own food; cloth (mostly wool and hemp)
for clothing and decor; leather; iron and coal to produce tools and simple weapons; and timber and stone for
construction.

  - **Mill** - The mill, owned by Matthew the Miller, is setup to process both lumber and grain. Ore is
    sometimes crushed here as well. It is powered by the waterfall on the west edge of town.
  - **Mines** - About a mile east of Westmill are the mines. While not very extensive, these mines provide
    for the town. Just outside of the mine are several kilns for making charcoal as well as a large stone furnace
    for smelting iron.
  - **Brewer** - Every town needs a brewery. Grain from the surrounding farms is processed to make beer.
  - **Blacksmith** - Aldrin Smith takes pigiron from the mines and works it into useful things such as hinges,
    nails, horseshoes, and tools. In times of need he can also make basic weapons.
  - **Tannery** About a mile east or Westmill near the mines, is the tannery.

## Government

The government of Westmill is typical of that of a small town or village of Men in Myridia. It consists of the
Decurio, the Council of Ten, and the Assembly.

### The Decurio

The Decurio is is primary executive authority of the government. He is in charge of the constabulary and the militia,
and judges all crimes. As is a member or the Town Council and is appointed by them from among their members to serve
for a period of five year. At the end, he returns to the Town Council. A individual can be appointed Decurio as often
as the Town Council see fit. The current Decurio is Felix Orbillius.

### The Council of Ten

The Council of Ten is a group of ten men of age 40 or older. They have three main functions: appoint the Decurio from
within their ranks, appoint new members to the Council of Ten, and declare martial law in times of crises. Council
members serve for life, but are free to resign if they wish, an act which tradionally happens a 70 years of age.

In addition to the powers of the entire Councile of Ten, individual members can veto any law that the assembly passes
within seven days of its passing.

### The Assembly

The Assembly consists of all Men and Dwarves in the town and surrounding area that are 21 or older and not a member of
the Town Council. Their primary function is to establish and abolish laws for the town.

### The Militia

Tasked with protecting the town and surrounding farms, the militia is made up of every able-bodied male over age 16 or
older. Everyone can be called up during times of need, but most serve only a couple days watching the city entrance and
the gates. Captain Falcidius is in charge of the militia, reporting directly to the current Decurio.

### Government Buildings

The government officials have to meet and work somewhere. Here are the places they use:

  - **Council Hall** - This is where the Council of Ten meet and the Decurio administers.
  - **Assembly Hall** - This is a large hall where the people of Westmill meet to practice democracy.
  - **Constabulary** - This small building houses a few cells, and is where Constable Theodosios and his two deputies.
  - **Armory** - The spears, shields, and bows that the militia uses are stored here. Captain Falcidius and whomever
    is currently on roration for the militia can usually be found here.

## Religion

Myridia is a world of numerous faiths. A village the size of Westmill could hardly have enough temples for all the gods.
Instead, they have a section of the town dedicated to all the gods. A small, circular walled garden, it has a central
open-air temple made from stone. At the center is an altar suitable for most worship. The gardens themselves is filled
with small shrines, stones, and carvings to hundreds of deities.

All of this space is maintained by the one cleric in town, Eric Everly. Eric spends most of his days tending gardens and
occasionally adding a new marker or shrine for a newly discovered diety. He lives is a small house in near the temple
grounds.

Funerals are also performed in the temple. The dead are buried in cemetary, also maintained by Eric, behind the temple
ground.
