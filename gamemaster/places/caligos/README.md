## Surface Denizens

  - Elementals - legacy of the elemental influence here
  - Fiends - pockets of them trapped from the Holocaust
  - Kobolds - the dominant power on the surface
  - Magical Beings - abandoned constructs, animated objects, and magical beasts were left behind when the Holocaust consumed the spellcasters in the area
  - Undead - the Holocaust left many traumatized spirits and the fiends animated many dead
  - Vermin - rats, snakes, giant bugs, and maybe even some lycanthropes inhabit the isolated corners of the ruins
