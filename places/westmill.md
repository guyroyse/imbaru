# Westmill

Westmill is a large village and has a population of almost 800. Most of the population are Men, but there are a few Dwarves who have settled down here as well.

## Commerce

It is off the beaten path and provide for most of its own needs. It has people and places to produce their own food; cloth (mostly wool and hemp) for clothing and decor; leather; iron and coal to produce tools and simple weapons; timber, brick, and stone for construction; and clay for pottery. More complex or luxurious items, like armor and swords, are available but harder to come by as they have to be acquired by trade.

That said, Westmill is along a trade route, albiet an infrequently traversed one. They export a surplus of wool, tobacco, and medicinal herbs. Traders come, or pass through, and Westmill is an obvious place to rest for the evening. To that end, there are two inns and a dining hall in Westmill.

Here are a few places of interest:

  - Barlow's Inn - Oswin Barlow run this basic inn and tavern where the prices are reasonable and the food is acceptable. Oswin himself is quite amiable and Barlow's is a good place to hear rumors.

  - Hearth & Eagle - John Arleigh runs the nicest inn and tavern in town. Prices are double normal but the food is excellent (try the braised cabbage and roast pork) and the beds are soft and warm. Every room is private and this is where wealthy merchants tend to stay.

  - Sally's Sundries - Sally Payton sells assorted and miscellaneous goods here.

  - Thor's Tankard - Run by Thor Ethelred, this dining hall and tavern is a popular place for locals and vistors alike. The food is good, the ale is plentiful, and the rumors are rampant.

  - Hammer & Shield - The only weapon and armor seller in town is a skinny, dark-haired man named Manius Valeria.

  - The Apothecary - Wanda Karlkin, a fast-talking Halfling runs the local apothecary. She gathers many of the herbs for her brews herself. A retired assassin, she has a backroom where she sells poisons to those who want such things.

## Religion

Myridia is a world of numerous faiths. A village the size of Westmill could hardly have enough temples for all the gods. Instead, they have a section of the town dedicated to all the gods. It has a central open-air  temple made from stone with a roof. At the center is a basic alter. The area surrounded the temple is a spacious garden with shrines to various deities. The edges of the garden are walled with locally made brick and stone.

All of this space is maintained by the one cleric in town, Eric Everly. Eric spends most of his days tending gardens. He lives is a small house in one corner of the temple grounds.

The dead are buried in Westmill. Outside of town there is a cemetary. Most of the folks who live on the farms have family plots.
