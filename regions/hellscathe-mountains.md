# Hellscathe Mountains

Hellscathe is a modern english rendering of the old english word for demon. Literally hell-criminal.

Rugged and rocky. Home to mountain goats, sheep, and the occaional demon left over from the Holocaust. There are a series of caverns here, with four entrances, that the demons dwell in. On rare occasion, the wander out of the mountains to bother isolated humans. However, the path is arduous and few bother. The cavern complex connects to the abanndoed dwarven mines west of the lake but the connection collapsed (or was triggered by survivors) during the holocaust and trapped the demons in the mountains.
