# Hag Swamp

A swamp with a hag. Friendly enough. Makes deals with the townsfolk and farmers on occasion. Primarily there to keep an eye on the humans in Imbaru for the Unseelie Fay to the south. Hut visible from other side of river.

Locals sometimes gather herbs in this swamp for their medicinal properties.
