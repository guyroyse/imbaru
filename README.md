# Imbaru

STOP! This repository contains all my notes and campaign details for a West Marches style megadungeon set in Myrida. If you are a player in this game or *want* to be a player in this game, read no further. Reading further will ruin the experience for you and the other players. You have been warned.

## Myridia

Myridia is a campaign world that will be detailed online at a future point. However, there are some key things about Myridia that are relevant if you want to run this campaign yourself. Read more about it [here](myridia.md).

## Imbaru

Imbaru is a small sphere in Myridia. It is home to a small human and dwarf settlement, the ruins of the city of Caligos, and some other interesting bits and bobs. It has a temperate and somewhat humid climate the makes fog a frequent visitor. With mountains to the west, hills to the east, and a wooded river valley down the middle, the fog tends to collect along the river and throughout the woods giving the lowlands an ethereal and mysterious quality. Ruins of previous occupation dot the landscape, including the ruins of the city of Caligos, a couple of watchtowers, and the remains of an ancient aquaduct.
