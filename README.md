This repository contains all my notes and campaign details for a West Marches style megadungeon set in Myrida. If you are a player in this game or *want* to be a player in this game, read no further. Reading further will ruin the experience for you and the other players. You have been warned.

## Myridia

Myridia is a campaign world that will be detailed online at a future point. However, there are some key things about Myridia that are relevant if you want to run this campaign yourself. Read more about it [here](myridia.md).

## Imbaru

Imbaru is a small sphere in Myridia near The Crossings but not connected to them. It has a temperate and somewhat humid climate that makes fog a frequent visitor. With mountains to the west, hills to the east, and a wooded river valley down the middle, the fog tends to collect along the river and throughout the woods giving the lowlands an ethereal and mysterious quality.

There are two gates that lead to neighboring spheres in Imbaru, one each on the north and south sides. An old tiled road connects the two gates, much of it broken and covered with dirt. The north gate leads to a large, glaciated mountain with the road marked by piles of stones. The south gate leads to a flat, arid desert with scrub, cacti, and boulders littering the landscape.

In the foothills of the [Hellscathe Mountains](regions/hellscathe-mountains.md) there is a large, shallow lake that forms the headwaters for a waterfall. The village of [Westmill](places/westmill.md) is located here and, true to it's name, there is a large, water-powered mill that uses the energy of the falls to grind grist and smash ore. Downstream and along the the [Gate Road](features/gate-road.md) are numerous farms providing for the village.

Of course, Men aren't the only inhabitants of Imbaru. There is a tribe of lizardfolk in [Big Swamp](regions/big-swamp.md) who sometimes come downriver to trade with the villagers and farmers. Kobolds are occasionally seen in the [Caligos Valley](regions/caligos-valley.md) by hunters but have never bothered anyone. Goblins are know to occasionally attack travelers in the south and bandits more frequently attack those coming from the north.

Ruins of previous civilizations dot the landscape. The most notable is the ruins of the [Caligos](places/ruins-of-caligos.md) but there are others including two old watchtowers observing the two gates, the remains of an ancient aquaduct that provided water to Caligos, and an old Dwarven mine and village on the far side of [Lake Abathos](regions/lake-abathos.md).
