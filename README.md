# Imbaru

This repository contains all my notes and campaign details for the West Marches
style megadungeon called Imbaru. Imbaru is an ancient city populated by many
peoples over the ages. The last group of people to inhabit Imbaru where a coalition
of Dwarves and Men who called the city Caligos.

## Brainstorm

  - was abandonded for 800 years
  - current inhabitants could be common demihumans
    - goblins, kobolds, something like that
  - destroyed during the Holocaust
    - surface show evidence of the demon horde
    - maybe some demons are trapped beneath or in sealed areas
    - other haunted things on the surface
      - undead and ghosts, skeletons
      - maybe haunted catacombs
  - most recent population was a mix of Men and Dwarves
    - men built with brick, dwarves with stone
      - this would be reflected on the ruins
  - Men and Dwarves built atop the ruins of the Elves
    - elves built city here because of elemental power deep below
    - dug too deeply and city was destroey or elves killed or something
      - ironic, dwarven line for elves
      - maybe there is a large bore hole that the elves dug to access the
        elemental power
          - not complete but ran into something else

  - Elemental power
    - originally the capital city of the earth elementals
    - they are still down there, dimished after the war with the Fey

  - broken gate
    - pieces of a ruined gate
    - destroyed when the elves dug too deep
    - lack of gate to the Crossing part of the reason elves left maybe?
    - ruins of the gate still in woods to east of Caligos
      - maybe the parts are in the city?
        - elves studied

  - the surrounding area has stuff too
    - lizardfolk in the swamps
    - owlbears in the woods

  - bridge in middle of map
    - built by dwarves during the last habitation
    - parts of the gate road are paved with stone
    - road to Caligos is growth over but many parts are still intact

  - the gates
    - all gates have elemental runes, they match the runes in deeper levels of the dungeon

  - These symbols abound on gates:
    - air 🜁
    - earth 🜃
    - fire 🜂
    - water 🜄
